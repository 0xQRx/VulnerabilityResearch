# Vulnerability Research Repository

## Overview

Welcome to my Vulnerability Research Repository. This space is dedicated to documenting and sharing my research on various security vulnerabilities discovered over the years. The repository includes detailed write-ups and proof-of-concept (POC) scripts, showcasing both the theoretical and practical aspects of cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

## Repository Structure

- `Year`: The repository is organized by year. Each year's folder contains relevant files and directories pertaining to vulnerabilities discovered or studied in that year.
  - `SomeSoftware-Vulnerability_Name.md`: Inside each year's folder, you'll find Markdown files named in format `SomeSoftware-Vulnerability_Name.md`. These files provide detailed write-ups on specific vulnerabilities, including their background, impact, and analysis.
  - `POC`: Accompanying these write-ups, the `POC` directory contains practical proof-of-concept scripts and tools demonstrating the exploitation of these vulnerabilities.
